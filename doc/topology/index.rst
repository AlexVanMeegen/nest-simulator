Topology
===========

The Topology Module is designed to build complex, layered networks in NEST.

* If you've never used topologically-structured networks before,  we recommend you
  check out the **PyNEST tutorial** :doc:`on Topologically-structured Networks <../tutorials/pynest_tutorial/part_4_topologically_structured_networks>`

* We also recommend another **tutorial** :doc:`using the Hill Tononi model <../tutorials/topology/index>`

* For a **comprehensive guide** into topology, please see our :doc:`Topology User Manual <Topology_UserManual>`
