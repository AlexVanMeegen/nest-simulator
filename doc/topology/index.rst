Spatially-structured networks
================================

Here you can find how to build complex, layered networks in NEST.

.. note::

  In NEST 2.x spatially-structured networks were in the topology module.
  This module is removed in NEST 3.0, and all functionality of topology
  is now in the main ``nest`` module.

  See the :doc:`guide to NEST 3.0 <../guides/from_nest2_to_nest3>` for more information.

* If you've never used spatially-structured networks before,  we recommend you
  check out the **PyNEST tutorial** :doc:`on spatially-structured networks <../tutorials/pynest_tutorial/part_4_topologically_structured_networks>`

* We also have a :doc:`comprehensive guide into spatially-structured networks <../guides/guide_structurally_spatial_networks>`

* We have a large selection of **examples** using spatially-structured networks, including a detailed example using the Hill and Tononi model
  check them out in our :doc:`Spatial networks examples <../examples/index>` section.
