Conda environment recommendations
=================================

This page provides a series of recommendations for installing NEST with
conda.

Create a dedicated environment for NEST
---------------------------------------

We recommend that you **create a dedicated environment for NEST**, which
should ensure there are no conflicts with previously installed packages.

Install all programs
--------------------

We strongly recommend that you **install all programs** you'll need, 
(such as ``ipython`` or ``jupyter-lab``) in the environment 
(``<envname>``) **at the same time**, by **appending them to the command below**.

Installing packages later may override previously installed dependencies 
and potentially break packages! See `managing environments in the Conda 
documentation <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands>`_
for more information.
