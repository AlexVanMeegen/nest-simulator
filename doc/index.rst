Welcome to the  NEST simulator documentation!
***********************************************



How the documentation is organized
####################################

* :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>` show you step by step how to get started with NEST. If you haven't used NEST before, this is a good place to start.

* :doc:`Example Networks <examples/index>`  describe specific use-cases of neural networks developed for NEST. The examples range frome simple :doc:`one neuron models </examples/one_neuron>` to more complex networks such as :doc:`Random Balanced Network Example with the Multisynapse Neuron Model <examples/brunel_exp_multisynapse_nest>`.

* :doc:`Topical Guides <guides/index>` provide deeper insight into several topics and concepts at an intermediate to high level. Here you can find guides to  :doc:`setting up your system with MUSIC <guides/using-nest-with-music>`, :doc:`Parallel Computing <guides/parallel-computing>`, details on :doc:`Gap Junction Simulations <guides/simulations-with-gap-junctions>` and :doc:`much more <guides/index>`.

* :doc:`Reference Material <quickref>` contains the command index and APIs for a quick look up of terms.
