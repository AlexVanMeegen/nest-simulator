 How the documentation is organized
####################################

* :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>` show you step by step how to get started with NEST. If you haven't used NEST before, this is a good place to start.

* :doc:`Example Networks <examples/index>`  describe specific use-cases of neural networks developed for NEST. The examples range frome simple :doc:`one neuron models </examples/one_neuron` to more complex networks such as :doc:`Random Balanced Network Example with the Multisynapse Neuron Model <examples/brunel_exp_multisynapse_nest>`.

* :doc:`Topical Guides <guides/index>` provide deeper insight into several topics and concepts at an intermediate to high level. Here you can find guides to  :doc:`setting up your system with MUSIC <guides/using-nest-with-music>`, :doc:`guides/parallel computing <parallel-computing>`, details on :doc:`Gap Junction Simulations <guides/simulations-with-gap-junctions>` and :doc:`much more <guides/>`.

* :doc:`Reference Material <quickref>` contains the command index and APIs for a quick look up of terms.

Getting Help
#############

* Check out the :doc:`FAQs <frequently-asked-questions>` for common issues.

* Our :doc:`video series <tutorials/videos/index>`provides instructon and examples for those who want a walk through of how to use NEST'S interface`.

* Have a question or issue?  Ask our `Mailing List http://mail.nest-initiative.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/nest_user`_

* Found a bug? You can `report bugs here <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/issues>`_ on our Github page.
