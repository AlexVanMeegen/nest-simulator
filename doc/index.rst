Welcome to the  NEST simulator documentation!
***********************************************


* :doc:`Download <download>` and :doc:`Install <installation/index>` NEST

* NEW TO NEST? Start here at our :doc:`Getting Started <getting-started>`_ pag
* Discover the dozens of `models <models/index>`_ NEST simulator has to offer.
* Need a different model? Check out how you can :doc:`create you own model <create_model>` here.
* Have a question or issue with NEST see our `Getting Help <getting-help>`_ page.

How the documentation is organized
####################################

* :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>` show you step by step how to get started with NEST. If you haven't used NEST before, this is a good place to start.

* :doc:`Example Networks <examples/index>`  demonstrate neural network models implemented in NEST.

* :doc:`Topical Guides <guides/index>` provide deeper insight into several topics and concepts at an intermediate to high level. Here you can find guides to  :doc:`setting up your system with MUSIC <guides/using-nest-with-music>`, :doc:`Parallel Computing <guides/parallel-computing>`, details on :doc:`Gap Junction Simulations <guides/simulations-with-gap-junctions>` and :doc:`much more <guides/index>`.

* :doc:`Reference Material <quickref>` contains the command index and APIs for a quick look up of terms.
