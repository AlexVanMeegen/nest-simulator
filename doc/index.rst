How the documentation is organized
####################################

* :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>` show you step by step instructions using NEST. If you haven't used NEST before, this is a good place to start.

* :doc:`Example Networks <examples/index>`  demonstrate the use of dozens of neural network models implemented in NEST.

* :doc:`Topical Guides <guides/index>` provide deeper insight into several topics and concepts from :doc:`Parallel Computing <guides/parallel_computing>` to handling :doc:`Gap Junction Simulations <guides/simulations_with_gap_junctions>` and :doc:`setting up topological network <topology/index>`.

* :doc:`Reference Material <ref_material/index>` provides a quick look up of model parameters, functions and terms.

-------------------------------------

The  `NeuralEnsemble <http://neuralensemble.org/>`_ is a community-based initiative to promote and co-ordinate open-source software development in neuroscience.
They host numerous software including `PyNN <http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/>`_, a simulator-independent language for building neuronal network models and `Elephant (Electrophysiology Analysis Toolkit) <http://neuralensemble.org/elephant/>`_, a package for the analysis of neurophysiology data, using Neo data structures.
