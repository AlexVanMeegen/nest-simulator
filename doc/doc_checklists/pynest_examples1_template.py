""" The Summary Line - Balanced Neuron Example
----------------------------------------------------------------

Example text for extended summary section.

This model implements X according to the Y model described by [1]_ and [2]_.

This script simulates a neuron driven by an excitatory and an inhibitory
population of neurons firing Poisson spike trains. The aim is to find a firing
rate for the inhibitory population that will make the neuron fire at the same
rate as the excitatory population.

Optimization is performed using the ``bisection`` method from Scipy,
simulating the network repeatedly.


Notes
------

Additional information can be included here regarding background theory etc.

The value of :math:`\omega` is X.
For the population and time-averaged from the spiking simulation:

.. math::

    X(e^{j\omega } ) = x(n)e^{ - j\omega n}
